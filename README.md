This app reads your emails, identifies recruiting emails, then drafts nice responses that politely tell them to fuck off. My unending attempts to remove my information from data-sellers have failed, at least I can automate my responses.

Ideally this would also go online and unsubscribe you from recruiting sites by making "do not sell my data" requests, but they now all have captcha and cloudflare bot detection...
