This is an app designed to unsubscribe you from all possible sites that have your data.


### TODO

1. scrape this list and convert into a csv https://inteltechniques.com/workbook.html
2. write a simple tool that can interact with the websites, filling in forms and navigating pages to unsubscribe from data
3. design an agent (with prompts) to use this tool and crush the list
4. add another tool that can search for other sites that might be storing my data
